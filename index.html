<body>
    Here we aim to optimise a cobb douglas utility function given a budget constraint the budget constraint.
    <br><br>
    Mathematically this can be written as 
    <br><br>
    Maxamise A * x^a * y^b such that p1x +p2y = m
    <br><br>
    Where A, a, b are constants and so are p1 - the price for good x and p2 - the price for good y and m - income.
    <br><br>
    Note here we are assumming that the budget is satisified with equality hence the constraint ( p1x +p2y = m) holds with equality.
    <br><br>
    Insert values of A, a, b, p1, p2 and m below:
